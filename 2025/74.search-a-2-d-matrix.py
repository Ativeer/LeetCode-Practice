#
# You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two
# properties:
# 
# 
# Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the
# previous row.
# 
# 
# Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false
# otherwise.
# 
# You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == matrix.length
# n == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 100
# -10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4
#
