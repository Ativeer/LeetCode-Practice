#
# You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where
# image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three
# integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image
# starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
# 
# To perform a flood fill:
# 
# 
# Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
# Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels
# that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically)
# and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
# Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated
# pixelsÂ and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the
# starting pixel.
# The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original
# color to update.
# 
# 
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
# 
# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# 
# From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red
# pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting
# pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
# 
# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or
# vertically connected to the starting pixel.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
# 
# Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target
# color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == image.length
# n == image[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 50
# 0 <= image[i][j], color < 2^16
# 0 <= sr < m
# 0 <= sc < n
# 
#

                return False
            return True

            image[x][y] = color

            directions = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]]
            for x_, y_ in directions:
                next_x = x + x_
                next_y = y + y_
                if __isValid(next_x, next_y):
                    dfs(next_x, next_y)
        dfs(sr, sc)
