#
# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search
# tree (BST).
# 
# A valid BST is defined as follows:
# 
# 
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
# key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
# node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        def dfs(node, high=math.inf, low=-math.inf):
            if not node:
                return True
            
            if node.val >= high or node.val <= low:
                return False
            
            return dfs(node.left, node.val, low) and dfs(node.right, high, node.val)
        return dfs(root)
